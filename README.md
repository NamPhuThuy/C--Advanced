# C--Advanced

# Week 1: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming & Design Patterns

Lectures: Deep dive into OOP principles (polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance), SOLID principles, common design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy), and their application in game development (e.g., managing game objects, AI).

Exercises: Implementing design patterns in C#, refactoring existing code to improve design.

Assignment: Design and implement a simple game system using a chosen design pattern (e.g., a state machine for enemy AI).

# Week 2: Memory Management & Performance Optimization

Lectures: Garbage collection in C#, memory leaks, profiling tools, optimization techniques (e.g., object pooling, reducing allocations), understanding the impact of memory management on game performance.

Exercises: Profiling a simple game, identifying performance bottlenecks, implementing optimization strategies.

Assignment: Optimize a given game segment to improve performance (e.g., reduce frame time).

# Week 3: Multithreading & Concurrency

Lectures: Threads, tasks, async/await, parallel programming, thread safety, race conditions, deadlocks, using concurrent collections.

Exercises: Implementing multithreaded game logic (e.g., background loading, AI processing).

Assignment: Develop a multithreaded system for a specific game task (e.g., loading assets concurrently).

# Week 4: Delegates, Events, and Lambda Expressions

Lectures: Advanced usage of delegates and events for event-driven programming, lambda expressions for concise code, functional programming concepts in C#.

Exercises: Implementing event-driven systems in a game (e.g., player input, collision detection).

Assignment: Create a custom event system for a game feature (e.g., triggering animations).

# Week 5: LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

Lectures: Using LINQ for data manipulation and querying, efficient data processing, working with different data sources.

Exercises: Using LINQ to query game data (e.g., finding enemies within a certain range).

Assignment: Implement a data-driven system using LINQ (e.g., loading game levels from a database).

# Week 6: Generics and Collections

Lectures: Advanced generics, custom generic classes and methods, efficient use of collections (List, Dictionary, HashSet), understanding collection performance characteristics.

Exercises: Implementing custom generic data structures for game objects.

Assignment: Develop a generic inventory system for a game.

# Week 7: Reflection and Serialization

Lectures: Reflection: inspecting and manipulating types at runtime, serialization: saving and loading game data, JSON serialization, binary serialization.

Exercises: Using reflection to inspect game objects, implementing a system for saving and loading game state.

Assignment: Create a system to save and load game progress using JSON serialization.

# Week 8: Networking Fundamentals (Optional: Choose one focus)

Option A (Unity): Unity's networking features (UNET or Mirror), client-server architecture, handling network messages.

Option B (Unreal Engine): Unreal Engine's networking system, replication, handling network latency.

Exercises: Implementing basic network functionality in chosen engine.

Assignment: Create a simple multiplayer game feature (e.g., a chat system).

# Week 9: Advanced Game Engine Integration (Specific to chosen engine)

Lectures: Deep dive into chosen engine's API, advanced scripting techniques, optimizing performance within the engine.

Exercises: Implementing complex game mechanics using engine features.

Assignment: Develop a significant game feature using advanced engine capabilities.

# Week 10: Project Presentation & Review

Lectures: Code review best practices, presentation skills.

Exercises: Peer code review.

Assignment: Present a final project showcasing learned skills. This could be a small complete game or a significant feature for a larger game.
